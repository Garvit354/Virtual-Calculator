# Virtual Hand Gesture Calculator

This project is a **Virtual Calculator** that uses **hand gestures** to interact with the calculator. In this no mouse or keyboard is needed! It uses your **webcam**, detects your hand using **MediaPipe (via cvzone)**, and allows you to press calculator buttons with just your fingers.

## Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **cvzone**
- **MediaPipe** (via `cvzone.HandTrackingModule`)

---

## How It Works

- Your webcam captures live video.
- The program detects your **index and middle fingers**.
- When your index and middle fingers touch (distance < threshold), it's treated as a "click".
- If your fingertip is over a button, it's considered pressed.
- The result or ongoing equation is shown at the top of the screen.
